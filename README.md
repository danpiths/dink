# Dink

This app helps me and my friends keep track of our milk and dinner expenses that is to split among each of us. We can enter when we bought milk and if we bought anything extra with it and also record the days we had dinner at our regular place so that we know how much is required to paid at the end of the month. Not styled for desktop, only styled for mobile views.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is used under the hood for all the backend functions and also integrated with Google Signin for Authentication.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is used for styling.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
